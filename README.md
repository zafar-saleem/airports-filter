# DBL Code Challenge: NuxtJS

This is a simple app to lookup airport information.

We expect you to work on this challenge for a maximum of 1h.
All data comes from a JSON file; for this challenge we don't need to set up a database to keep it simple.

We mainly care about your thought process, which can include
* edge-cases you would think of before shipping this to production
* what makes for a great UI for this?
* how well would it scale and what we might need to change for high traffic?


## Objective

Imagine the designer gave you the following mock up:

We want a simple UI that allows users to find and display an airport.
You may assume, that a collegue will do any backend changes and thus pretend it works as expected.
For missing functionality, explain to what and why you would need. Bonus point if you can do small adjustments yourself.


## Deliverables
* A video of your screen recording where you guide us through your challenge (unlisted YouTube, Loom, .. any platform from where we can stream the video works)
* Do not push a public fork with your solution, instead keep it unlinked to the original repo or make it private (if private, please invite @marcqualie and @swiknaba)


## Getting Started

The app is designed to work out of the box with no external dependencies, other than node modules.

```shell
yarn install
```



## Running locally

```shell
yarn dev
```

Once started, the app should be available via http://localhost:3000
